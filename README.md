# Brain-Tumor-Detection_Mobile-Application
Hai guys! This repo is specifically for Brain Tumor Detection using mobile application. 
## First step: Create a simple CNN model for brain tumor detection. This was done using Kaggle datasets.
Kaggle dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jananiharshu/brain-tumor-detection-simple-cnn

Second step: To convert the trained model to tflite

Third step: Create a andriod studio application
