# Brain-Tumor-Detection_Mobile-Application
Hai guys! This repo is specifically for Brain Tumor Detection using mobile application. 

# First step: Create a simple CNN model for brain tumor detection (Brain Tumor detection.h5)
This was done using Kaggle datasets.
Kaggle dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jananiharshu/brain-tumor-detection-simple-cnn

# Second step: To convert the trained model to tflite 
(Refer https://github.com/Janani-harshu/Brain-Tumor-Detection_Mobile-Application/blob/main/modelconverter.py)

The converted tflite model can be seen in https://github.com/Janani-harshu/Brain-Tumor-Detection_Mobile-Application/blob/main/model.tflite

# Third step: Create a andriod studio application
Refer Andriod Studio.7Z zip file (written in java)

#  Screenshots of app results -->
